        "name": "A Wrinkle In Time",
        "content": "The story begins with a young girl named Meg Murry.<br />An intelligent thirteen-year-old girl facing many difficulties at her school. Her problems at school aren’t the true source of her troubles, however. Meg’s father, a great scientist, has mysteriously vanished for over a year, while he was away on business.<br />Meg also has two twin ten-year-old brothers, Dennys and Sandy, who by our standards are regular children. Meg, however, has another sibling, Charles Wallace, the youngest member of the Murry family. The young five-year-old is by all rights a genius, but also, unfortunately, faces his own difficulties at school.<br />One stormy night, a mysterious and eccentric older woman, by the name of Mrs. Whatsit visits the Murry’s home. During her conversation, she delivers a message to Mrs. Murry that there is such this as the Tesseract. This is a so to speak, a wrinkle in time which can be traveled through. This news startles Mrs. Murry but fills Charles and Meg with great curiosity.<br />The following day, filled with curiosity, Meg and Charles go to visit Mrs. Whatsit home, which happens to be nearby. On their way to the house, they come across Calvin O’Keefe who is a popular boy from Meg’s school. Though skeptical at first, they allow Calvin into Mrs. Whatsit’s dwelling. At the house, the trio learns from Mrs. Whatsit and her friends, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, that the universe is in great peril. There’s a powerful entity called The Dark Thing, which has taken the form of a giant cloud. The Dark Thing is currently engulfing all the stars and planets surrounding it. One of these planets includes Camazotz, which is the planet Meg’s father, Mr.Murry is being held, prisoner.<br />The W’s use a tesser, to open a wrinkle in time. This allows them and the children travel into the 5th dimension and arrive at another planet. This planet is Uriel, where the children get a chance to observe the Dark Thing itself. Not only catching a glimpse of the truly massive size of the dark entity but also its destructive power. Also while on Uriel, the group encounters an oracle, which informs them of the path they should take, to reach Camazotz.<br />The group travels to Camazotz, and the three Mrs.W’s instruct the children to stick close together while here. Everything on Camazotz looks almost identical, as the entire planet has been subjected to the power of “IT”. “IT” is a giant disembodied brain, which controls the entire planet from it rhythmic pulses. Charles Wallace goes into combat with IT but unfortunately loses, where he falls under ITs control. Charles is transformed into a robotic creature which speaks using the words IT has infused into him. The mutated Charles leads Meg and Calvin to Mr. Murry’s location, where the new group proceeds to confront IT. IT, unfortunately, proves to be too powerful for them. However, through the quick efforts of Mr. Murry, the group escape to Ixchel by the use of a tesser.<br />Ixchel is another planet within this dimension, which is inhabited by tall furry beasts, who Mr. Murry and the others find refuge with. Charles Wallace still under ITs control remains, as ITs prisoner on Camazotz. Mrs. Whatsit, Which and Who appear on Ixchel and converse with Meg and the group. Meg realizes that it’s up to him to return to Camazotz and rescue her brother. Mrs. Which informs Meg that she does, in fact, have a weapon she can use against IT. It is the one thing IT does not have, but Meg must figure out what this weapon is, on her own. Filled with the desire to save her brother, Meg returns to Camazotz, for her final confrontation with IT."

        "content": "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,  thank you very much. They were the last people you’d  expect to be involved in anything strange or  mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such  nonsense.<br />Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called  Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy  man with hardly any neck, although he did have a  very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and  blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of  neck, which came in very useful as she spent so  much of her time craning over garden fences, spying  on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son  called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer  boy anywhere.<br />The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they  also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that  somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they  could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.  Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t.<br />Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended  she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her  good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it  was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think  what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in  the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a  small son, too, but they had never even seen him.   This boy was another good reason for keeping the  Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a  child like that.<br />When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray  Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the  cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and  mysterious things would soon be happening all over  the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out  his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley  gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming  Dudley into his high chair. "

        "content": "When Bilbo of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.<br />Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at.<br />Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty.<br />At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved ; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark.There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth."

        "name": "The War of the Worlds",
        "content": "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.<br />With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.<br />At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.<br />The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.<br />It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence."
